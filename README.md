# ISCAS Netlist Simulation and Boolean Expression Generator

This project implements a **Gate-Level Logic Simulation Tool** using Python. It supports **ISCAS-format netlists** and provides both **simulation outputs** and **Boolean expressions** for output nodes. Ideal for educational use, this tool helps understand digital circuit behavior at the gate level.

## üìò Project Summary

- **Title**: Simulation and Boolean Expression Generation from ISCAS-Format Gate-Level Netlists  
- **Technology**: Python (standard library only)  
- **Authors**:   Urmit Kikani (22BEC137)  
- **Institution**: Nirma University, Institute of Technology  
- **Submitted for**: Testing and Verification of Digital Circuits (TVDC)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

-  Parses [ISCAS-format gate-level netlists](ISCAS%20netlists%20for%20an%20input/)
-  Identifies **primary inputs and output nodes**
-  Performs **logic simulation** for given input vectors
-  Generates **Boolean expressions** for output nets
-  CLI-based input prompts for interactive simulation

## üî¨ Simulation Workflow

### 1. Load and Parse Netlist
- Reads a `.txt` netlist file with ISCAS gate-level formatting
- Builds internal circuit representation using Python dictionaries

### 2. Input Assignment
- Prompts user to assign binary values (0 or 1) to all **primary input nodes**

### 3. Logic Simulation
- Evaluates each node in the circuit using logic functions:
  - AND, OR, NAND, NOR, NOT, XOR, XNOR, FANOUT
- Simulates the full circuit and propagates signal values

### 4. Expression Generation
- For each output node, builds a **recursive Boolean expression**
- Reflects logical dependencies from inputs to outputs
